4. Use predictive analytics techniques to create a model that can predict the sustainability score of a company based on their CSR report.

- Use machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, or random forests to create a predictive model based on the key indicators identified in step 2.
- Train the model on a subset of the data and test it on the remaining data to evaluate its performance.
- Fine-tune the model to improve its performance using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Once the model is finalized, use it to predict the sustainability score of other companies based on their CSR report.

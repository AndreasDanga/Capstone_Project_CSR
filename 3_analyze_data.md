## Step 3: Analyze the data using descriptive analytics techniques to identify trends and patterns in the approach of companies towards sustainability.

After collecting and cleaning the data, the next step is to analyze it using descriptive analytics techniques. This will involve identifying trends and patterns in the approach of companies towards sustainability. Some techniques that can be used include:

- Time series analysis: This technique can be used to identify trends in the sustainability practices of companies over time. It can help identify which areas companies have improved in and which areas still need work.
- Correlation analysis: This technique can be used to identify relationships between different sustainability indicators. For example, it can be used to identify if there is a correlation between a company's carbon emissions and its water usage.
- Cluster analysis: This technique can be used to group companies together based on their sustainability practices. It can help identify which companies are leading in sustainability and which ones are lagging behind.

By using these techniques, we can gain insights into the sustainability practices of companies and identify areas for improvement. These insights can be used to make recommendations for companies to improve their sustainability practices.
